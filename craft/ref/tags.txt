A tag is a Python dictionary entry attached to a “Craftable” object.  These tags are used in the crafting system to determine what objects are suitable for use in a crafting recipe.  They can be used in two ways: either to check for the existence of a tag (stored in the key field of the dictionary) or for the value of a specified tag (the value field for that key in the dictionary).  If the key is not found, the default value is 0.
